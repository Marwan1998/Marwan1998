# Hello ðŸ‘‹
## I'm ***Marwan Algadi*** and this is my github page.

Iâ€™m a passionate Software Engineer specializing in Laravel and AWS cloud engineering.
I build scalable web applications, APIs, and dashboards, with strong expertise in database design (MySQL, MSSQL), authentication, and integrating external APIs. My curiosity and drive for learning have also led me to explore Node.js, React.js, and Vue.js. Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to new challenges and deliver innovative web applications.
